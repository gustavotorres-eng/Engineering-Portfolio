# 🛠 Engineering Portfolio — Gustavo Torres

This repository is a **technical archive of my robotics, control systems, and physical AI projects**.

Each project contains:
- simulation videos  
- analysis plots  
- control code  
- CAD files  
- and detailed documentation  

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate how I design, simulate, and validate **real-world electromechanical systems** under realistic constraints.
